Some info
==========

This was my first take on a serious solo javascript project.

The initial repo was hosted on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/migvkscript)

The original version was distributed throught [userscripts.org](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/54446).


* Installations: `60k+`
* Active users: `5k+`
* Active community users: `2k+`
* API Breaches found and used: `10+`


What's that anyway?
===================

This was a userscript for enhancing the [vk.com](http://vk.com) user interface.

I have created features like:

1. Showing who had added the user to favs
1. Showing who had deleted the user from friends
1. Hovering menu for fast actions
1. Customizable page layout with window system
1. Draggable window for chats (*implemented by vk.com in 2012*)
1. Sound notifications (*implemented by vk.com in 2012*)
1. Groups administration enhancements (bulk ban/unban, bulk delete)
1. Configurable styles on the user's page
1. Music/Video download
1. Support for Opera and Firefox
1. Ajax update for all ticks (*implemented by vk.com in late 2010*)
